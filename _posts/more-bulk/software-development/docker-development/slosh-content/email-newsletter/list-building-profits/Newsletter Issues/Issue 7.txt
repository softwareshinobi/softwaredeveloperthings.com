Email #7: Making Your List A Responsive One (Part I)

Dear <firstname> ,

In the previous email we talked about how your list
could be stuffed full of a large number of freebie 
seekers who only want  to leech off you and not 
actually purchase anything solid. 

Today you will learn how to build a responsive list,
that is, one with targeted, hungry buyers stepping 
over each other wanting to purchase your products!

Now obviously, the absolute best list you can build 
is a list of buyers.  That’s a list that is ultra targeted 
and responsive, of course. But lets start from the 
fundamentals for now. 

Just because there are freebie seekers flooding your 
list, that doesn’t mean you can’t give free stuff away. 
Indeed, offering “bonuses” usually boosts subscriber 
rates.  However, what you need to do is focus on offering
these bonuses to a targeted market – people who are 
willing and able to buy your product.

One way to do this is to build your list off of your sales 
letter page. 

The other way is to make collecting the email address a 
part of the sales process (e.g., by using a “squeeze page”
 where you collect an email address before people can 
learn more about your product).

Yet another way to do it is to embed the sign up form 
within the sales letter in an appropriate place – for example,
at a certain point it may make sense to offer a free sample
chapter (if you’re selling an info product), which you provide
 in exchange for an email address. Note: Be sure to tell them 
that they are also signing up for a newsletter. 

I'm actually not done with the other pointers, 
so watch for the next email!

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
