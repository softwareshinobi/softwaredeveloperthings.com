Email #6: Getting Your Prospects To Come To You

Dear <firstname> ,

In this modern world full of direct marketing 
and advertising, everyone is trying to grab their
prospects attention with loud, aggressive methods
which actually turn them off.

In the previous email we talked about you searching
for profitable niches and targeted buyers who are 
willing to fork out cash for what you have to offer. 
Today, you're going to learn how you can make your
target market come to YOU.

Sometimes when your prospect has a problem they 
are going to go actively search for a solution.  If you 
come to the top of the search and present yourself as
a credible business with a good solution and a good 
USP (unique selling proposition) – in short, if you 
give the prospect what she desires most – she’ll buy
 from you.

Some of the best forms of advertisement you can use
 include methods where customers search for you, 
such as newspaper classified ads, Yellow Page ads, 
search engine optimization, pay per click ads, directory 
listings.

However the main disadvantage to this is your ad is 
placed in front of an un targeted audience. Over time, 
you may discover that a large number of people on your
list are un targeted in that they are freebie seekers.  

And in the next email, you are going to find how you
can weed them out.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
