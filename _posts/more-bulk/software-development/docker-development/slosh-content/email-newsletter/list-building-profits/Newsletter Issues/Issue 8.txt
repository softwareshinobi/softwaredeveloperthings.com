Email #8: Making Your List A Responsive One (Part II)

Dear <firstname> ,

Continuing where we left off, we are still on 
the topic of building a responsive list.

Here are a couple of tried and tested methods
seasoned marketers use to build up their lists:

-Create a list that announces discounts and similar
 information on your market's products.  Obviously
 the only people who are interested in discounts are 
those who are willing and able to buy.  Minimally, 
you can state upfront that people can obtain a discount
on your products if they sign up for your newsletter list. 

-Another example of building a responsive mailing list
 is to do a JV with another marketer in the same niche. 
For example, on each other’s product download pages 
you can recommend signing up for the other’s newsletter.

-Then, there is the traditional way of setting up a page for 
the exclusive purpose of building a mailing list.You may 
use various marketing methods to drive traffic to this list, 
such as pay per click search engine traffic, regular search 
engine traffic, forum marketing etc.

In order to build a responsive list, you need to focus on 
“selling” them your newsletter.  No, you’re not selling them
on getting a freebie in exchange for their email address.  
You’re selling them on signing up for and reading your 
newsletter.

The main focus should be on the newsletter.  Otherwise 
you’ll get people who’ll sign up just to get your freebie, 
and then likely not read your newsletter.  What you want
are people who sign up to read your newsletter, but they 
accept the freebie as a nice bonus.

Next, we're diving right into building a hyper responsive
list for your online business. Fasten your online seatbelts!

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
