Email #2:  The Equipment You'll Need (Part I)

Dear <firstname> ,

Professionals in different occupations need their
specialized tools to do their jobs. Doctors use 
stethoscopes, divers have their wetsuits and oxygen
tank, so on and so forth.

As a list building specialist, you too need tools that
make the job of creating that profitable list much
easier. So here are the tools of the trade, in no particular
order:

-Domain Name:
Depending on whether you are going to build a list focusing
on one specific topic or a broader list, you will want to 
choose either a generic domain name or one targeted 
towards your niche market.  

You want your domain name to be memorable and easy to 
spell. Avoid hyphens, numbers and misspellings.

-Hosting Account:
I suggest signing up for a basic hosting account without too 
much fancy stuff 

In order to get started , you will also need to set up an 
autoresponder system that will deliver your messages in a
timely manner, based on how you have customized the settings
and pre-determined the mail out times. 

-Autoresponder:
Subscribe to one that suits your needs best. These are a wonderful
 way to automate your follow up, when you have to keep in touch
with your customers regularly. 

You might find it easy to keep in touch with, say 200 or 300 people, 
but when the list runs to thousands, a good Autoresponder can help
you tremendously in keeping up with your reminding and emailing. 

There's just one last tool that needs to be covered...in the next email.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
