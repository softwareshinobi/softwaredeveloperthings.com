Email #13: List Building Tactics - Ebook

Dear <firstname> ,

There are tons of methods that marketers use to
entice people to subscribe to their list. For now,
I will be focusing on the ebook as a carrot most
marketers prefer to dangle.

The Ebook is usually offered as a sign up bonus 
– when the customer leaves his email I.d and name.
Nowadays you need not even go through the trouble 
of writing your own ebook. You can outsource it to
writers who then give you the full resale rights of 
the book. After you get your ebook ready, ensure 
that you add your optin page or autoresponder URL
to every page of the ebook, to help the user find you 
right away. 

You can make an ebook that runs to several pages or
just a few, there’s no standard length. People like to 
receive free ebooks, particularly if they are interested
in the information it contains.

An ebook given away free draws the visitor to your website. 

Just a few suggestions for utilising the Ebooks are:

- Offer the complete ebook in return for referral email 
addresses or testimonials, which you can use.

-Writing your own ebook makes you look like a specialist 
or professional in your field, and builds credibility. 

-Offer just the first two chapters of the ebook, giving the visitor 
the choice to buy the full ebook.

The other way to attract sign ups is by using an ezine, which
will be covered in the next email.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
