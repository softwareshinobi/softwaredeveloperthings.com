# 9 Resume Blunders That Can Cost You The Interview

## Introduction

Submitting your resume isn't about sweating out an all-purpose document with fancy job words that gets you all the jobs.

Nor is a resume about submitting it to every place you can find especially on a "what the heck" basis.

## Overview

Your resume is your personal marketing piece.

It's what gets you in the door.

It's what gets you an interview.

If you want the interview, make sure your resume is not representative of any of these 9 errors.

## Resume Blunder #1 // A Bland Or Generic Objective

If your objective could be applied to a Software Developer’s Resume as easily as to a Project Manager's Resume then your objective says nothing and will get you nowhere.

An objective is NOT some required paragraph at the top of the page that is an exercise in 5 lines of "job speak".

Your resume is an actual and real description of your skills as they're related to who you are and what you want.

Resumes should vary with the type of job for which you are applying. 

## Resume Blunder #2 // Proofreading: Grammar / Spelling / Punctuation

Use the grammar and spell check function on your text editor.

 then print it out and read the document word for word out loud

Spell checker doesn't know that you meant "manager" when you actually typed "manger."

Consider running your resume through grammarly by the way

## Resume Blunder #3 // Bland Job Details

Here is how most people’s resume looks: 

"Responsibilities included integrating back-end API with React front end with Vue JS"

Ok... So what?

That doesn't say much about what you did. The challenges. The Triumphs.

Differentiate yourself from the others coming in to interview for the job that YOU want.

If you don't tell the hiring company how you will be an asset to them...

Then how will they know? 

And if the hiring people do not think that you will be an asset to the Team, you will not be getting hired to their Team.

## Resume Blunder #4 // Another Job, Another Paragraph

Don't keep adding job after job, on to your resume year after year.

By the time you're in your 40s, you need to have weeded out some of the earlier stuff. 

We must keep the page size down to 2 pages!

You don't need all the college activities, just your degree.

You don't need many bullets for each of your first two jobs. 

For older jobs... you don't even need to put bullets at all. 

## Resume Blunder #5 // References

References shouldn't be listed on your resume. 

Don't even mention it. It would take up space.

If someone wants references, then you can mention that later. But not on your resume.

Even putting "References available on request" is doing too much. You present them separately when they're requested. 

--

Also This isn't 100% about protocol and resume space.

This is about protecting your references so they aren't called until you and the company are serious about each other. 

--

And personally... I don't want a job that is asking for resumes. That's just my own personal politics. 

You do you though.

## Resume Blunder #6 // It's Not A Story!

Don't - whatever you do, DON'T - write your resume in the third person! 

## Resume Blunder #7 // Skip The Personal Info

You might think your weekend baseball coaching or your church choir participation shows you're an interesting and well-rounded person...

but they're irrelevant.

If the interviewer wants to know who you are as a person, aside from the job interview and your qualifications, they will ask. 

## Resume Blunder #8 // Hiding The Degree Date

No matter how old you are, don't leave the date of when you graduated off your resume.

It looks like you're hiding something.

Then everyone counts the years backwards and tries to figure out how old you are.

Sometimes you can be ruled out just for leaving the date off.

If you're trying to hide your age by not stating the date..

What else might you not be forthcoming about? 

## Resume Blunder #9 // Not Spell Checking Your Resume

Spell checking visually by you AND someone else, any fewer than three times, isn't enough.

Run your resume through a text to speech tool.

Grammarly and a decent text editor.
