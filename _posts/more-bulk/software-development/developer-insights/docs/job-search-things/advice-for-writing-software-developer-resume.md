# Advice for Writing a Resume

## Introduction

If you ever plan on getting a job or starting a career of some kind, you will have to have a resume.

That's not exactly breaking news.

In this chapter we highlight Key Resume writing Advice.

## Why You Need A Good Resume

If you ever plan on getting a job or starting a career of some kind, you will need to have a resume.

There really isn't an alternative. Sorry.

## So what is a Resume?

A Resume is not just a piece of paper that gives the employer some information about yourself.

But rather...

A Resume is something that will set you apart from the others applying for the same position.

## There Is No Magic Resume Formula

One would like to think that there is one way to write a resume, and that if you follow that exact formula, you're set.

That is not the case. It almost never is the case. That isn't how Life works.

Each employer is different, so some might like one style over another. So don't get wrapped up in the Idea of the most correct, most perfect format or style.

There isn't one. It doesn't exist.

So with that said, below I highlight some tips that will direct you and your Resume in the right direction.

## Give Less Information, Not More

One thing that we see over and over again in resumes is an overload of information.

A Lot of people think quantity will impress people over quality.

This is how many people think:

    • "Add more bullet points!"
    • "Let's mention one more thing I did"
    • "I want to talk about that one thing i did that one time for two weeks"

--

No. Don't. Please don't. 

If that sounds like you... Stop it.

Why?

Employers are busy people, and don't have all day to dig through a mountain of information on your Resume.

So keep it informative, but to the point.

Don't add things in there that aren't relevant to the job that yoi want.

--

And also... nobody cares enough to read through all that conteng.

Too much BS is a great 2ay to get your resume thrown in the trash.

## Keep Your Resume To One Page

In keeping with the "to the point" rule, keep your resume to one page.

No exceptions.

I don't care what somebody on YouTube says. I don't care what you heard from the person down the street.

One page.

Sorry... not Sorry.

Take out the weak content and make a one page resume happen.

## Longer Isn’t Always Better

People have a sense of pride about a long resume.

Thinking that a longer resume makes them appear more qualified.

A hiring person shouldn't have to scroll through pages to learn about you.

A Resume longer than a page is a good way to get your resume ignored.

Nobody cares enough to invest time reading all your Resume content.

You might care... but nobody else does.

Sorry to break it to you.

One page.

## What Should You Include On Your Resume?

• Your Name and contact information

It's kind of pointless handing in a resume if they can't get back to you. :) [who you are]

You think everyone knows to do this, but they don't.

You'd be surprised.

• Your Objective

There are quite often other positions to fill, so make sure to specify what you are applying for. [What you want]

• Your Skills

What you know how to do and what you can offer to a project

• Technologies apps platform tools

What tools and tech do you use to satisfy your job activities.

• Experience

Make sure once again that you are showing quality, and not quantity. If you are really weak in the experience area, still be careful as to not make it seem like you are just trying to fill in some space. [What you've done]

* Training and Education

List your training and education with the most recent being on top. List only what is related to the job. Make sure to list any side classes you took that could be related to the job. [Where you learned]

* Call To Action.

Give the Reader the next step that you want them to take [what to do next]

## My Personal Font Tips 

Although you want to keep a resume to one page, you can't force it by using small text.

I find that a font size of 12 or so does the trick.

Anything smaller than a point size of 11 is pushing it, and might make it hard to read.

This is especially the case if the employer is older.

One test to see if the font is too small is to ask a parent to read it.

If they have to squint or move the resume back and forth until they find a good reading distance.

You might have something that is challenging to read.

## The Best Fonts To Use

Fonts that you might want to use are Times New Roman, Arial, Garamond, Bookman, or Helvetica.

These are easier to read, and can be found pretty much on any computer.

Don't bother with crazy script fonts or other fun looking fonts.

You want to make sure your resume reflects professionalism and structure, not a casual direction or feel.

## Make Sure That Your Resume Has Room To Breathe

Don't clutter and squeeze things in just to fit them in.

Adding some space creates a nice visual organization and flow.

This visual organization breaks down the page into more manageable pockets of information.

And makes it easier for an employer to find what they are looking for.

It's very hard scanning through information when it's all squished together...

So keep it nicely spaced.

## Conclusion

In the end, make sure you keep your resume simple and to the point.

Don't add what you don't need to for the sake of making you look busy or important.

Just add what is necessary to reflect the important aspects that will make yourself a good fit for that company. 

Give the resume room to breathe, and don't skimp out on the printing process.

Follow these simple guidelines, and you'll be well on your way creating a rock solid resume, and a strong impression on employers.
