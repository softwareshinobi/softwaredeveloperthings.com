## Question

Good Morning everyone, how do you start your day to make sure you’re successful?

For me i have multiple jobs and a few businesses so a big part of my success is organizing my screens and calendars.

I start with a morning prayer 

I check the stock market and my portfolio 

I double check my calendars to see if there is any overlap 

Cut on ESPN 

Then I check out a YouTube vid or podcast on something I’m working on (this week buying more land)(these run in the background)

I eat breakfast and get my morning started.

## My Response

i've found i work better fasted. so in the mornings, i eat cake and coffee and water only.

when i'm not being aint-shit, i do qi gong and stretch, cuz i'm old.

when i'm in my Creator bag, i'll set aside time for focused visualization of the life that i'm manifesting.

Them screens gonna tear your eyes up youngblood.

install some blue light filter apps on all those computers!

turn the brightness down and the font size up.

Hard lessons i've learned after a career sitting in front of hella screens.
