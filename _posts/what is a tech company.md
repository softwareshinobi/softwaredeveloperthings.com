the issue is that there is no meaning for a 'tech' company.

papa john's pizza has linux servers, developers, data centers, managed identity platforms, managed mobile device management, and databases.

according to yahoo finance, papa johns is in the restaurants sector.

so more importantly...is papa john's pizza a tech company?

if not... then what makes you a tech company.

--

as mentioned an employee being a cost center is more important than anything else.

whether you work for exxon mobile corporate or apple or papa johns...

there is a person in the account department that says you cost the company money everytime you show up for work.
