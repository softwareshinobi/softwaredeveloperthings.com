Apart from basic requirements of any resume, a Software Developer Resume is required to be short and precise.

In the following sections I will lay out some tips to help you create your Resume with Intention.

Your Intentional Resume Should Say What You Want

The headline section is your opportunity to tell the Universe what you want!

Start with a brief headline describing your career goal and one or two of your top qualifications.

These two things will show your sense of direction to the employer. 

## Give Less Information, Not More

Your Intentional Resume should have the names of each of your employers and your corresponding job titles, as short as possible. 

Use What You Have To Get What You Want!

Your Resume should mention any technical or computer qualifications.

Any personality development, certifications and diplomas.

Mention the source, content brief, the duration, institute and also its result to your former employers.

## Toot Your Own Horn

Emphasize your accomplishments and contributions in your Resume, no matter what your Job Roles have been.

For example:

Created data pipeline using centralized ingestion layer reducing data load time bottlenecks by 30% so that end users could view transaction data faster in Dashboards.

## Showcase Your Core Competencies

To showcase your core competencies include an "area of expertise" section on your Resume.

For example:

    • Software Testing
    • Systems Design
    • Cloud Engineering
    • Security Controls
    • Front End Development
    • Azure Administration

Whether it's building a new product feature, improving efficiency and productivity within your Team or the Software Project in general.
