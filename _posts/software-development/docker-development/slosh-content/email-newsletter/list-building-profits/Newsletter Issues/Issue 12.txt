Email #12: Power Of The AutoResponder

Dear <firstname> ,

As mentioned earlier, Autoresponders are one
of the most powerful tools you can use in building
your list.

Autoresponders can be exclusively used to send 
routine follow up emails to the thousands of contacts
on the list. You can plan and keep your emails ready,
and set the autoresponder to send it at the specific 
intervals you want. Practically every single routine 
emailing activity can be handled by the autoresponder,
which is why no online marketing can do without it. 

You only have to keep your messages ready, decide 
on a sending schedule and your autoresponder takes 
care of the rest for as long as you have set it. This will 
mean that you can concentrate on other equally important 
issues while your sales keep coming in, thanks to your 
autoresponder’s faithful follow up.

Instead of using the same: dear subscriber: for all your
contacts, you can make your autoresponder address each
contact by name and send the email.

Use the autoresponders to track your lists. Make carefully
thought out offers to your target audience, then structure
your message accordingly so that it appeals to them.

Autoresponders help you in keeping in touch with your 
subscribers, giving them relevant information about your 
businesses, say, when you get fresh stocks or if you are 
planning a discount sale. 

You can also get your autoresponder to get activated 
when a contact signs up at your website. But most 
importantly, you need to leverage on it to get your
emails out to all your subscribers as and when you want to.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
