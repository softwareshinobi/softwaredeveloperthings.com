Email #9: Making Your List Hyper Responsive

Dear <firstname> ,

We’ve talked about how to build a targeted list 
(e.g., building a mailing list of customers, eliminating
 freebie seekers, etc).  The natural next question is:
how do you make this list hyper-responsive?

Think about some of the lists you are on.  Are there 
some that you just can’t wait to rip open and read 
when they come in?  Why is that?  What makes those
particular lists different than the newsletters you trash 
without reading?

For you, you could have an ultra targeted list of “junkies”
in your niche, or a list of existing customers, will create
a hyper-responsive list. Example, toy collectors.

But what if you’re building a list of prospects (not existing 
customers), and you know the majority of them aren’t 
“junkies” in the niche or a fanatic in that niche/hobby?

In that case, you need to know and understand your readers,
 and give them what they want.  You want them to look 
forward to your newsletter, and read it every single time it 
comes into their inbox.

If your readers are looking for exclusive discounts on products,
 form joint ventures with other marketers and deliver those 
discounts in every newsletter.

If your readers are looking for tips they can’t find anywhere 
else, deliver those tips accurately so that your readers can’t 
wait to read your newsletter.

If your readers are looking for honest reviews of new products,
deliver those reviews accurately so that your readers can’t wait
to read your newsletter.

Next, we'll show you how to make your list come ALIVE...

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
