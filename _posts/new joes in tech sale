# new job in tech sales / social media question 

## question

Greetings everyone! 
I just received an IT Consultant partnership role to sell software services to businesses in States. I came from a science background, particularly pharmaceutical industry. However, I also have some experience in tech from end users type of roles in a large enterprises. Anyone on here with tech sales experience and what are suggestions on how to succeed in this field? Thanks in advance.

## response

get in tight with the development team.
i was a software developer consultant doing technical sales support in the private sector, enterprise, government, etc.
in my experience, it's you (the tech sales person) meeting with client people with the developers/integrators (me).
during technical presentations and showcases, you are the one talking during show and tell. and i'm clicking around in the apps during show and tell.
we do alot of show and tell together. gotta sell them projects!

anyways... the dev team.
the dev team knows how everything is wired. how it's all connected. where it's broken. where the bandaids are.
We know what's fantasy and what's realistic.
the "suits" (you are a suit in this scenario) will say one thing to the client about the software and shit and capability.
usually, what yall say isn't always rooted in real life. the dev support team will know the answers about the tech. the real answers, not whats 'on the website' or on the slidedeck.
know who those people are.
there is ALWAYS one developer/tech person who knows EVERYTHING. find out who that is and sit down with them and figure out what's going on.
and you should probably ask how much access you have to the dev team.
i didn't "report" to my sales guys. but i showed up to meetings or buildings when it was time to go on the road show.
it's me and them running through demos, and apps, and demo scripts.
your mileage will vary. ionno what you got going on. and i could have mis-read your intent. hope this helps.
my first thought it to ask how much of the developers you get access to.
i'm also biased. i'm a developer.
namaste.
