# Resume 101: Change How You Think About A Resume

## Introduction

On the macro, software Developers over complicate what a Resume is.

In this article we talk about a different perspective to consider for resumes.

## What A Resume Really Is

A resume is a self-promotional document that presents You in the best possible light as a Software Developer.

The Resume gets you invited to a job interview...

Nothing more. Nothing less.

## You've Got 8 Seconds To Get Their Attention

Research shows that you have 8 seconds to get someone's attention before they lose Interest and go elsewhere.

So think about this:

Everyday Hiring Managers receive hundreds of resumes every day.

Especially for in-demand Remote Developer jobs.

In just a few seconds (a mere glance) a hiring person will decide whether or not to call a Software Developer in for an interview.

If your resume is not conveying the right message, it will land-up where most Resumes do.

The trash.

## Find And Add In Relevant Keywords

Companies often use automated resume software that contains thousands upon thousands of Software Developer Resumes.

Including Yours.

When your Dream Coding Job comes on the market, keywords are used to find the right resumes from the thousands of resumes stored in these Resume Databases.

If your resume does not contain the right keywords, there is a good chance your Resume will never be found during such searches.

So.. add some relevant keywords related to the Job that you want.

Mentioning specific technologies and frameworks is a good start.

## A Resume Is Marketing & Advertising In Action

A resume is not just a typed up sheet of paper telling someone where you used to work and write software at.

Your Resume is a strategic tool to enhance your chances of getting a job as a software developer.

A thoughtfully created resume that considers these things will help shorten your overall job search time.

## Conclusion

A well-written, keyword-rich, resume not only impresses employers but also reduces the overall time it takes to find a new programming job.

Good Resumes get the interviews, and the more interviews you get, the higher your chances are of getting your Dream Job.

Thatâ€™s what you want, right?
