Email #11:What List To Choose...?

Dear <firstname> ,

Today we are going to talk about different
kinds of lists in online marketing. You must
be thinking 'aw, man, how many kinds of lists
do I have to master?' Relax, only the proven 
ones will be taught by yours truly, so get ready,
and here we go:

The opt-in list:

An opt-in list is your list of subscribers who opted
to receive your email, ezine, newsletter or whatever
you offered when they signed up.  It means they 
have allowed you to contact them via email. Here, 
a targeted opt in list would be a list of users who 
have been qualified for your specific market. Your 
subscriber becomes a part of your email list.

Opt in lists are informal and brief. They are full of tips
etc. and have limited period offers. Invariably opt in 
lists are mailed when something new is to be introduced
or to tell its users about a limited offer.

The double opt-in list:

Double opt in is when your subscriber opts in two times.
How? First on the website when he/she click and confirm
their subscription after giving their email id and name. After
this they click on the link sent to them at the email address 
which they signed up with to confirm their subscription. 
This is to make 100% sure that the email your subscriber 
gave isn't a fake one.

Opt out is when your subscriber asks for his/her email address 
to be deleted from your list when they no longer want to
 receive messages from you. They can do this through the 
“unsubscribe” link that you include in your emails to them.

WARNING: Never, ever, give your subscribers email as spam
to anyone shady. That could be the end of your Internet business.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
