## About the author

My name is Bobby Iliev, and I have been working as a Linux DevOps Engineer since 2014.

I am an avid Linux lover and supporter of the open-source movement philosophy.

I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it, and I believe in sharing knowledge.

I think it's essential always to keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone.

You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.
