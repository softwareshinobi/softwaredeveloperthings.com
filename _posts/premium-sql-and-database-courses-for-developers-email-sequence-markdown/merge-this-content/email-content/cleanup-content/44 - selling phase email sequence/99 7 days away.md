# 2023 BOOTCAMP opening in 7 days

Hi!

In just 7 days, on January 24th, I'm opening up registration for the 2023 cohort of the Full-Stack Web Development BOOTCAMP.

This isn’t your typical online course.

The BOOTCAMP is a fully immersive experience, a journey: YOUR journey to becoming a Web Developer.

We're going to start the year on the right foot by focusing hard for 10 weeks.

Wake up every day knowing that these 10 weeks will change your life forever. By the summer you'll be calling yourself a Web Developer.

In this 10-week intensive cohort course, we're gonna dive deep into the fundamentals of web development, HTML/CSS, Tailwind, React, and Next.js, and work with relational databases, interfacing with them using Prisma.

I'm going to be your guide through the wonderful world of modern web development, and we'll be working on demos and leveraging the Discord student community for support and motivation. 

I'll be present on the student's community chat as much as possible to help you reach your full potential as a developer. With my 20+ years of experience, I'll make sure to break down the complexity and guide you in the easiest way possible.

Once you finish the 10-week cohort course, you'll get access to the second phase of the Bootcamp: PROTOTYPED, a library of 10 projects built using React, Tailwind, Next.js, Prisma, all with production-grade code, clean design, and step-by-step instructions on how to build them from scratch.

This is where you can apply all the techniques you learned in the first 10 weeks, and it's more open-ended: you can decide with more autonomy which projects you prefer to work on.

Now I want to go over some of the frequently asked questions I get about the upcoming Bootcamp.

“How much does it cost?”

I’ve made pricing very affordable for a course of this kind. In-person bootcamps can easily cost $10,000 or more, but thanks to the format I've designed, you can join the entire course for just $399, taxes included.

And if you're worried about not having the entire sum upfront, don't sweat it, you can pay in 10 weekly installments without any additional charge.

And for students, unemployed individuals, senior citizens, and citizens of developing countries, I've got a big discount for you, bringing the total cost down to just $249 or $24.99 per week.

And for those of you who joined the bootcamp in 2020, 2021, or 2022, you can come back and join again with our alumni discount for just $199.

“When can I sign up?”

Sign-ups start on Tuesday, January 24th, and are open until January 31st. The bootcamp officially begins on February 1st, 2023, and I won't be accepting any new sign-ups after that date.

“Will you repeat the Bootcamp later?”

I only organize the bootcamp once a year, so the next edition will be in 2024.

Will access to the lessons expire after the bootcamp?

No, you'll have access to the lessons even after the bootcamp is over, so if you need more time or want to use them as reference material, no problem.

Is it up to date?

Yes, each cohort of the Bootcamp is fully up to date with the latest technologies. You'll be learning the current hot technologies on the market, and industry standards, all at their latest versions. You won't find any outdated techniques or obsolete technologies here, just the best of the best.

Is there a community of students?

One of the best parts of the Bootcamp is the community. It's a place to exchange ideas, ask questions, make friends, get motivated, and follow the progress of your fellow students.

How is the format? Are there live lessons?

The Bootcamp is organized asynchronously. I can't expect you to tune in at a specific time or day because we’ll have students from every timezone. So you can pick the time that suits your daily routine best, early morning, late evening, afternoon, weekends - whatever works for you.

The chat provides the live aspect. Any time of the day you will always find a lot of people in the student's chat and I’ll be there as much as possible, helping you get over any problem.

Like this one from Adam:

“I took Flavio’s bootcamp in 2021 while I was unemployed, and it is one of the best things I’ve done for my career. While at the time I felt the content was a little basic, in retrospect this is only because Flavio does such a great job of breaking down concepts. I gained so much knowledge about web technologies I was exposed to daily but knew little about. Even things I did have some knowledge about, like deployment, were enriched through the bootcamp—now I know about other services I can use to deploy apps more quickly as well as knowledge about how to utilize webhooks to continuously deploy to servers I set up. I still use skills I learned from the bootcamp in my current job as a test automation engineer and am often teaching the skills I learned to more junior members of the team too. Thanks, Flavio!”

If you have any questions that aren't answered on the website or in this email, just email me and I'll get back to you.

Note: this is a launch and I’ll be sending more emails next week. If you want to mute the launch, click here and you'll still stay signed up for my normal newsletter with free tutorials and ebooks
