It’s time to become a Web Developer!

## Email Body
Hi,

2 days ago I opened enrollment for the 2023 cohort of the Full-Stack BOOTCAMP.

In the past 48 hours, 193 people have already joined this powerful training program.

Will you be one of them?

Let me tell you some key points about the Bootcamp.

The program is divided into two parts.

The first part begins on February 1st and will last for 10 weeks. During this time, participants will have an intensive full immersion into HTML/CSS/Tailwind/JavaScript/React/Next.js/PostgreSQL/Prisma. 

At the end of Part 1, participants will unlock Part 2, where they will gain access to 10 real-world projects tutorials made using the technologies we learned in the first part of the Bootcamp. Part 2 is less intensive, allowing participants to choose which projects they want to work on depending on their preferences, and time availability.

Typically, offline bootcamps can cost $5000 or even $10000+ but I made this online bootcamp much more affordable, with generous discounts available for students, unemployed individuals, senior citizens, and citizens of developing countries (just reply to this email if you qualify for a discount). You can check all the pricing details on the website.

Signups are open for the next 5 days, until Tuesday, January 31st.

Let's make this the year you change your life and become a Web developer for real.

If you're still unsure, take a minute to read feedback from former course students on the Bootcamp home page.

Here's a testimonial from Carlos:

“At the time I was unemployed and non-able to pay for a bootcamp. Thanks to Flavio's financial help I could join a high-quality bootcamp. By studying seriously his bootcamp + free material, I was able to land a job as a full-stack software developer. Flavio’s bootcamp contains the latest technology that gave a huge advantage over other candidates. Flavio is a great programmer, a great teacher, but especially he has a golden heart”

And here's a review from Johannes of the 2022 cohort:

“The Bootcamp 2022 was really amazing. After a brief introduction to JavaScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind, databases and REST API we practiced building real projects, also deployed in production. These projects were really exciting, especially because they combine frontend and backend functionality. In combination with an online database, it is now possible for us to build great projects ourselves. It is precisely this aspect that makes this course so valuable for me. I’m very motivated to continue programming and improve my skills! I am proud to be on this level now, thank you Flavio!”

Head over to bootcamp.dev for all the details.

PS: This is a course launch and I'll send out more emails this week. If you'd like to mute the launch, click here and you'll still be signed up for my regular newsletter with free tutorials.
