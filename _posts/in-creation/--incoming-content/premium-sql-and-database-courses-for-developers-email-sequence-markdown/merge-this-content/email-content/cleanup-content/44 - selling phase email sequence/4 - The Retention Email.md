# Email #4 – The Retention Email

## Email Subject

Hi,

we're almost ready to officially start the 2023 edition of the BOOTCAMP!



The BOOTCAMP is a cohort course designed to help you become a Web Developer.

This program is offered only once a year and is a special opportunity for anyone interested in developing their skills in Web Development.

Sign-ups will close in less than 48 hours, so now is the time to make your decision.



This Bootcamp is the best training program I've ever created, and it is the training program I wish I had back when I started my career, back in the day when I was a fledging, wannabe Web Developer.

Over the course of 10 weeks, we will be learning the fundamentals of creating modern web apps using React and Next.js. We'll start from the basics and work our way up, focusing on the core concepts needed to create real-world projects.

In addition to learning the fundamentals, you will also have the opportunity to work on 10 different real-world projects, including e-commerce sites, private membership sites, SaaS applications, job boards, and clones of popular platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube.

At the end of the Bootcamp, all the training material will be yours to keep and use as reference material and a handy code repository for future needs.

I believe that this Bootcamp has the potential to dramatically improve your skills and enhance your career.

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Over 330 individuals have already enrolled in this cohort, and I'm sure it's going to be an exciting and productive way to start the year. Don't miss out on this opportunity.

Will you be one of us?



“I have learned a lot and really could expand my knowledge. One of the main things I learned: there's so much more you can do with JavaScript today compared to 10 years ago, so it is inevitable to stay up to date. This bootcamp is the right place because you get information that starts from zero to advanced modern topics. And the Discord chat gives you the opportunity to discuss with the other participants in order to seek and provide help or just to chat. I can recommend the Bootcamp to everyone who is involved in web development!” -- Marco
