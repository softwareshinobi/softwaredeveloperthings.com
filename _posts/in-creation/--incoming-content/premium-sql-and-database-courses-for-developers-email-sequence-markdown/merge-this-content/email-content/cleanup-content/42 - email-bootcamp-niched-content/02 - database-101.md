## body content

Howdy [[first-name]]!

This is the next lesson first lesson of the [[mailing-list-brand-name]] brought to you by [brand-ambassador-name]] at [[brand-website]].

## What We Covered Yesterday

In our last lesson we talked about being a SQL Developer, the career outlook and the day in the life of a SQL Developer.

## what we are talking about today 

Before we dive deep into SQL, let's quickly talk about relational databases at a high level. 

In this lesson we will talk about:

what databases are
the types of data in databases
why use databases at all
The structure of a database

## what is a database?

A Database is an organized collection of related data.

where the data is stored and organized to serve some specific purpose.

## Databases All Around Us

You've most likely worked with spreadsheet systems like Excel or Google Sheets.

At the very basic, databases are similar to spreadsheets.

Each spreadsheet document has multiple tabs of tables.

Each table has different ‘columns’ which can have different types of data.

Relational database systems vastly improve on the data capabilities of a simple excel spreadsheet.

## what is a relational database system?

A relational database management system is called an RDBMS for short.

An RDBMS is a collection of application programs.

These application programs allow the user to organize, restore and retrieve information about data.

The aim is that an RDBMS does this data retrieval as efficiently and as effectively as possible.

## Why use a relational database system instead of spreadsheets 

The primary benefit of the relational database model is that it provides an intuitive way to represent data and allows easy access to related data points.

Meaning you can quickly store, catalog and retrieve data that is important to an application.

## Types Of Data You Can Put In A Database

A typical enterprise grade Relational database management systems like Oracle or MySQL can store many types of data in the databases.

Here are a few:

strings of text
Time stamps and dates 

Blob content 
Simple and complex numbers

Geospatial coordinates
Encrypted passwords 

And so much more.

## Tables va Fields vs Records

When developers talk about databases sometimes there is confusion between tables, records and columns.

We are going to break down each of these data we words and provide examples.

## understanding database tables

A: Table is the collection of records of specific types. 

For Example:

the Employee table is a collection of records related to all the employees.

## understanding Database columns

A field refers to an area within a record that is reserved for specific data. 

For Example: Employee ID, account balance, number of cars in stock.

Note: a database column can also be called a “field”.

## understanding database records

Record: Record is a collection of values or fields of a specific entity. 

For example:

Tony stark, stark industries, chief executive officer

All together these three data points make up a record.

## Summary Of Today’s Lesson

Today we talked at a high level about databases, Relational database systems and the basic concept of data storage in a database.

## In Our Next Lesson

Coming up next time we will connect to the official boot camp training database system and start running our out first queries.
