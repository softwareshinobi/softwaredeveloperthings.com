## What is PLR and How Can it Help You Earn Income

There’s a lot of ways to earn money online but one of the best ways is to utilize PLR products. PLR is the acronym for Private Label Rights. If you’ve been involved with internet marketing for some time you are likely already familiar with PLR content. If you aren’t familiar with private label rights then it’s time you were. Products include master resell rights, regular resell rights, source code rights, and just about every other right you can think of. 

It can be a bit confusing understanding what any of this means and how it will affect your bottom line. For example, what does it mean when you get “resell rights?”  What can you do with a PLR e-book that has resell rights? Sadly there’s no official definition and there’s a lot of interpretation. 

This can make dealing with PLR content a bit frustrating but the key is to simply ask questions when you are unsure. What this means is you must always read the license agreement associated with the product to get the specifics and understand exactly what rights you have or don’t have. Here are a handful of definitions you should be familiar with.

## Private Label Rights

This gives you the right to put your name as author or creator, and then resell the product. Sometimes you are able to claim copyright, but other times the copyright remains with the original owner. The majority of PLR products allow you to change the product itself. For example with an e-book or article you can receive it as a Word .doc file and then alter it and save. If it comes as a PDF file you can convert it, make your changes, and then resave as a PDF file. 

## Resell Rights

Here you are allowed to resell the content or product and you are entitled to the money it generates. You will have to use the product as it is, as you are not allowed to change it in any way.

## Master Resell Rights

Here you can resell the content or product, plus you can sell others the rights to resell these products. In a few cases you may even be able to resell the master rights.

## Branding Rights

With branding rights you are permitted to put your name on the product then resell it. You can usually add an affiliate link if you wish. Master resell rights may or may not be included. 

We’ll just stress the importance of reading your licensing agreement since each is different and you don’t want to find yourself in a precarious situation.

## Three Main Types of PLR Content

Of all the resell types on the market the most profitable is the PLR. It allows you to sign your name to the material as if you are the author, put your company links throughout the content, and make the product appear to be all your own. There are three main types of PLR content. Let’s have a look. 

## #1 PLR E-books and Articles

PLR e-books and articles have been around for a long time. Not only are they the most popular PLR choice they are by far the most efficient and they offer an opportunity for significant revenue when played properly. E-books range in length from 20 to 50 pages. They are an effortless product when it comes to marketing, and they are often sold through a pre-made sales page or website. When a proper sales letter is used they can become highly appealing and the resell value is considerably higher.

E-books and articles are the number one choices in PLR content. They can be used in a number of ways. You can convert the e-book into articles, while you can take a set of articles and convert them into an e-book. This content can be used in newsletters and in blogs. There’s a great deal of flexibility here. 

## #2 PLR Scripts

Scripts are like software, which can be used on websites. They are extremely versatile and much more convenient than traditional software. PLR scripts can easily be converted to your own product(s), and used. You can also upload them to any website and begin to perform right away. 

There are a number of sites that offer PLR scripts and the pricing of these is very low. There are autoresponders, graphics, auto, and websites that are already built. A bit of scouting around and you’ll find exactly what it is you are looking for. 

## #3 PLR Software Products

When you find a top-notch PLR software product it’s worth investing. Most PLR software has a higher resell value than other forms of PLR content. Always do your research before investing in PLR software. It generally comes with customer support and knowledge bases, and provides an excellent choice for a niche market. 

There is a hidden danger with PLR software and that’s the lack of customer and technical support. If a software program does not run properly and there is no support it’s you they are going to be angry with. What’s the solution? Making sure the support is there. 

If you are looking for an opportunity to increase your revenues you’ll want to consider PLR content.

## Are You Confused by PLR Rights

PLR rights let you use the work of another author like it’s your own by making changes. Those changes can be a little as adding an introductory paragraph or as complex as rewriting the entire content. Any time you can change content that’s someone else’s its considered Private Label Rights. 

A word of caution here – just because you have PLR rights doesn’t mean you have the copyright. It also does not automatically mean you have other rights, as is the case with reprinting or reselling. It’s important that you know exactly what rights are being given to you when you purchase PLR content. 

The PLR hype began many years ago offering strictly reprint rights. Since its inception many things have changed. Today there are a number of rights offered. Reprint rights are rights that allow you to re-distribute another author’s work, that’s previously been published. While seen a great deal online, it’s also common in other businesses. 

The terms resell, reprint, and resale are commonly interchanged. If you obtained PLR material make sure you fully understand what rights are being given to you. Occasionally you will even receive master rights, which allows you to redistribute the content or product and trade the reprint rights. 

If you’re feeling just a tad bit confused, you’re not alone. Relax – once you understand the various terms, they can apply or they may not. 

* Give away the product
* Split the product down into articles
* Package the product with other products
* Give away a branded version with your affiliate links
* Allows the buyer to sell resale rights.
* Give it away as a bonus,
* Offer the product in a membership area
* Use it as web content 
* Modify the product 

While you don’t have to memorize the checklist, it’s a good idea to be very familiar with it. If the PLR content you are looking at doesn’t offer you reprint rights there are the questions you should be asking to find out just what you are allowed to do.

Even when you think you’ve got it under control and that you’ve figured it all out things go wrong. For example, you buy reprint rights to some great content, only to find out after the purchase is through that the only way you are allowed to sell the product is through the link the seller provides, where he then has people signup to a newsletter thereby siphoning off your potential customers. That’s deceptive, but sadly it happens. 

The good news is that most time buying PLR material is great just make sure you ask all your questions before you make your purchase.

Sometimes you will buy PLR content that is poorly written or that you don’t agree with, so rewriting will ensure your traffic gets the message you want them to receive.

2. Give PLR Content a New Purpose – if the PLR content you purchased was an e-book you can break it down into a bunch of articles or blog posts. If it was a pack of articles you can turn it into an e-book. Bottom line is you don’t have to use the material provided in the format it is provided.

## Make Money With a Private Label Rights (PLR) E-Book

Private label rights offer you so many opportunities to generate a solid income, and that certainly true with the PLR e-books. It takes time to create an e-book and if you must hire someone to write the book you incur significant cost. When done correctly, you can turn your PLR e-book investment into significant profits for your website. The key is to not be selling the same exact e-book as hundreds of other sites. So what do you do? Glad you asked!

Those marketers that are successful with the PLR e-books purchase products that have a license that allows for the copy to be re-written. Before you part with your money it’s important to know what your PLR purchase allows you to do and what it forbids your to do.

The PLR e-book license will outline what you are entitled to do. For example, you may or may not be able to claim authorship or whether or not you own the copyright. Watch out for those sites that boast you’ll be able to do anything you want once you purchase the PLR product. This is not true! There are certainly some PLR e-books that offer full rights to the e-book but you can’t assume that’s the way it is since  just as many times it is not.
