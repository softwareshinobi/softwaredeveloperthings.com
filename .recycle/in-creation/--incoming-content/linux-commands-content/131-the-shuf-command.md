# The `shuf` command

The `shuf` command in Linux writes a random permutation of the input lines to standard output. It pseudo randomizes an input in the same way as the cards are shuffled. It is a part of GNU Coreutils and is not a part of POSIX. This command reads either from a file or standard input in bash and randomizes those input lines and displays the output.

## Syntax
```
# file shuf
shuf [OPTION] [FILE]

# list shuf
shuf -e [OPTION]... [ARG]

# range shuf
shuf -i LO-HI [OPTION]
```

Like other Linux commands, `shuf` command comes with `-â€“help` option:
```
[user@home ~]$ shuf --help
Usage: shuf [OPTION]... [FILE]
  or:  shuf -e [OPTION]... [ARG]...
  or:  shuf -i LO-HI [OPTION]...
Write a random permutation of the input lines to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -e, --echo                treat each ARG as an input line
  -i, --input-range=LO-HI   treat each number LO through HI as an input line
  -n, --head-count=COUNT    output at most COUNT lines
  -o, --output=FILE         write result to FILE instead of standard output
      --random-source=FILE  get random bytes from FILE
  -r, --repeat              output lines can be repeated
  -z, --zero-terminated     line delimiter is NUL, not newline
```

## Examples:

### shuf command without any option or argument.

```
shuf
```

When `shuf` command is used without any argument in the command line, it takes input from the user until `CTRL-D` is entered to terminate the set of inputs. It displays the input lines in a shuffled form. If `1, 2, 3, 4 and 5` are entered as input lines, then it generates `1, 2, 3, 4 and 5` in random order in the output as seen in the illustration below:

```
[user@home ~]$ shuf
1
2
3
4
5

4
5
1
2
3
```

Consider an example where Input is taken  from the pipe:

```
{
seq 5 | shuf
}
```

`seq 5` returns the integers sequentially from `1` to `5` while the `shuf` command takes it as input and shuffles the content i.e, the integers from `1` to `5`. Hence, `1` to `5` is displayed as output in random order.

```
[user@home ~]$ {
> seq 5 | shuf
> }
5
4
2
3
1
```

### File shuf

When `shuf` command is used without `-e` or `-i` option, then it operates as a file shuf i.e, it shuffles the contents of the file. The `<file_name>` is the last parameter of the `shuf` command and if it is not given, then input has to be provided from the shell or pipe. 

Consider an example where input is taken from a file:

```
shuf file.txt
```

Suppose file.txt contains 6 lines, then the shuf command displays the input lines in random order as output.

```
[user@home ~]$ cat file.txt
line-1
line-2
line-3
line-4
line-5

[user@home ~]$ shuf file.txt
line-5
line-4
line-1
line-3
line-2
```

Any number of lines can be randomized by using `-n` option.

```
shuf -n 2 file.txt
```

This will display any two random lines from the file.

```
line-5
line-2
```

### List shuf

When `-e` option is used with shuf command, it works as a list shuf. The arguments of the command are taken as the input line for the shuf.

Consider an example:

```
shuf -e A B C D E
```

It will take `A, B, C, D, E` as input lines, and will shuffle them to display the output.

```
A
C
B
D
E
```

Any number of input lines can be displayed using the `-n` option along with `-e` option.

```
shuf -e -n 2 A B C D E
```

This will display any two of the inputs.

```
E
A
```

### Range shuf

When `-i` option is used along with `shuf` command, it acts as a `range shuf`. It requires a range of input as input where `L0` is the lower bound while `HI` is the upper bound. It displays integers from `L0-HI` in shuffled form.

```
[user@home ~]$ shuf -i 1-5
4
1
3
2
5
```

## Conclusion

The `shuf` command helps you randomize input lines. And there are features to limit the number of output lines, repeat lines and even generate random positive integers.
