One more thing.

At the end of January I will organize The Web Development Bootcamp.

It's a 10-weeks long cohort online course where I will guide you to becoming a Web Developer.

It's not "just a course". It's a big event I organize once a year.

We'll start from zero, learn the fundamentals of Web Development, HTML CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, Git, using the command line, VS Code, GitHub, Node.js, we'll then learn React, JSX, how to use PostgreSQL, Astro, Next.js, Prisma, deploying on Netlify/DigitalOcean/Fly/Vercel and much more! 

At the end of the first 10 weeks you'll know how to create web sites and web applications and I'll unlock you the 2nd phase of the Bootcamp: you will get access to a large number of projects exclusive to the Bootcamp graduates, so you can follow my instructions to build things like private areas with authentication, clones of popular sites like Twitter YouTube Reddit, create e-commerce sites, and much much more.

Because once you got the fundamentals, you only learn by working on real, exciting projects.
