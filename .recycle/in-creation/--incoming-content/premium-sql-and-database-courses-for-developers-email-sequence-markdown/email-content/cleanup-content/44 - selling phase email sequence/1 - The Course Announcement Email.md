2 weeks to the 2023 BOOTCAMP

## Email Body

Hi 

In just 2 weeks I will open signups to the 2023 cohort of the BOOTCAMP.

It’s not easy to break into Web Development these days.

The tools are getting more and more complex and it seems like every month there’s a new shiny technology everyone talks about.

It’s even more difficult keeping up with everything and stay on top of the field.

No one wants to be left behind, with irrelevant skills.

It’s hard to figure out what to focus on, and who to trust in this busy world.

“What’s the best way to learn?”

“What's the course that helps me finally become a Web Developer?”

Here I am.

I created this BOOTCAMP to help YOU.

First, let me tell you this. I have a degree in Computer Engineering and I’ve got more than 15 years of professional experience working as a Web Developer. It hurts me to tell you this, as it makes me feel old. But I think it’s helpful to know I’ve accumulated a lot of real-world experience, having worked in the field for so long. I mean, I bought a JavaScript book in 1998!

I now dedicate my entire working life to helping YOU become a developer.

My goal is to provide you with the PERFECT WAY to break into the Web Development industry.

I’m talking about this BOOTCAMP.

This very BOOTCAMP that’s about to start in 2 weeks.

I’m so excited to open the doors of this brand new cohort of my bestseller course.

Over 3000 students joined in the first 3 editions.

This one will be the best edition EVER.

Here’s the timeline of the important dates you need to know about:

January 24: SIGNUPS OPEN

January 31: signups END

February 1: the BOOTCAMP officially STARTS

So.. if you’ve got to remember 1 date, it’s January 24.

That’s when registrations open.

I’ll also open the BOOTCAMP COMMUNITY CHAT on Discord, where you can meet with all the students of the cohort and start your journey toward becoming a Web Developer!

Once the BOOTCAMP starts, every week I’ll release a new module.

We’ll have 10 modules in total.

And this is a cohort course, so each week every student will receive access to the lessons, and we’ll complete the module, all at the same time. Discussing all the questions and challenges on the Discord community chat!

With a “normal course”, it’s too easy to drop out. No one’s watching you. No one is keeping you accountable. But in the BOOTCAMP you’ll feel the ENERGY. You’ll have friends in the chat, rooting for you. Helping each other. We can do it together. And I'll be there to help as much as I can.

I know you’re curious about the content of the modules.

Let’s see what we’re going to learn!

MODULE 1 (Feb 1 - Feb 7)

In the first module of the Bootcamp, we'll get started in the world of web development, regardless of your background. If you already know something about web development, this module might seem a bit basic, but I am sure you’ll have something to learn. I think it'll be a good opportunity for a refresher and you will also learn something new perhaps. With that said, in this module we will learn the fundamentals of the web, client-server architecture, web browsers, what are URLs, then we’ll dive into HTML and CSS.

MODULE 2 (Feb 8 - Feb 14)

In this module, you will learn how to design UIs using the main layout systems of CSS: CSS Grid and Flexbox. Then we’ll learn Tailwind CSS, which is an incredibly useful library we’ll use throughout the Bootcamp to design interfaces. We’ll learn how to use it to style web pages and we’ll compare it to plain CSS. We’ll also explore responsive design, a way to create interfaces that work well regardless of the size of the display and device used by the users.

MODULE 3 (Feb 15 - Feb 21)

After learning HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, in this module we are going to learn the basics of JavaScript. All the rest of this course is built on JavaScript. React is based on JavaScript. Next.js is built on JavaScript. Basically, all the web is built upon JavaScript. And this module is the base upon which we build the rest of this course. We will start from the basics of this wonderful programming language and we will learn its core features.

MODULE 4 (Feb 22 - Feb 28)

In this module, we continue the exploration of the JavaScript language. We learned the basics in module 3, but there are some more features I want you to know. Then we’ll start talking about the browser features, like the DOM, event handlers, cookies, browser storage, the devtools, and more.

MODULE 5 (Mar 1 - Mar 7)

In this module I’m going to introduce a set of tools you will use in the next part of the Bootcamp, in particular VS Code, the terminal, Git, and GitHub You’re going to need these tools in your whole career. Those are solid power tools you will use all of the time. They are the 4 things I use the most every day, as a developer. Then we’ll see how to use GitHub to deploy a simple website to 2 application hosting platforms: Netlify and Vercel.

MODULE 6 (Mar 8 - Mar 14)

In this module, we’ll learn what is Node.js and how to use it to write server-side JavaScript. How to use 3rd party modules and how to use Express to build a REST API. We’ll then introduce forms, we’ll see how to style them with Tailwind CSS, and how to use forms to create interactive interfaces. We’ll also do some demos.

MODULE 7 (Mar 15 - Mar 21)

In this module, we’ll learn React. React is a very popular and incredibly powerful library to create interactive user interfaces on the Web. We’ll learn its core fundamentals, introducing topics like components, JSX, props and managing state, then we’ll see how to style React applications with Tailwind CSS and we’ll see how to work with forms. Then we’ll do a few demos to get up to speed with React.

MODULE 8 (Mar 22 - Mar 28)

In this module, we’ll learn Next.js. Next.js is a framework that is built on top of React, providing some very useful features that make our life easier. It’s especially useful to create websites based on multiple pages. Really handy. It’s an industry standard, very popular, and highly requested. I’ll introduce its basics and we’ll see how to deploy a Next.js site on Vercel.

MODULE 9 (Mar 29 - Apr 4)

In this module, we will focus on databases. Databases are tools that host our application’s data and take care of storing that data and making it available to us when we need it. We will introduce what databases are, we will introduce SQL, which is the language we use to talk to the database. Then we’ll see where to host a database, how to create database tables, how to add data into those tables with SQL, and how to retrieve data using SQL queries.

MODULE 10 (Apr 5 - Apr 11)

In this last modul, we will learn about 2 different topics, to prepare for PHASE II. The first topic is Prisma, which is a great JavaScript library for working with databases that we’ll use in the projects as it’s really helpful. It will allow you to work with SQL databases at a higher level. The second topic is how to implement login and authentication in Next.js using a library called NextAuth.js, which is a very popular library that abstracts away many of the difficult parts of implementing authentication. So we can plug in this library and get authentication on our Next.js apps.

 

After module 10, PHASE I - the conceptual part of the BOOTCAMP - will be completed.

At this point, it’s April 12.

We’ve spent weeks preparing for this moment.

We’re finally ready for PHASE II

You’ll get access to PROTOTYPED.

What is PROTOTYPED?

PROTOTYPED is a collection of 10 real-world projects, all of them built using all the technologies we learned in PHASE I: React, Next.js, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS.

Modern, popular, highly requested technologies everyone in the industry is using these days.

All projects use the latest versions of those libraries because no one has time to learn outdated stuff.

These are 10 well-made projects you can actually learn from.

Solid bases upon which you can build a portfolio of projects.

Here’s a brief introduction to those projects:

Twitter clone

Build a clone of Twitter with Next.js, focusing on the core aspects of how a social network like Twitter works. We’ll implement authentication, creating a profile, tweeting, replying to tweets, and much more!

Job board

Build a two-sided marketplace application: a job board. We’ll have people that submit jobs, and people that apply to jobs, so we’ll handle the experience of both those scenarios.

Reddit clone

Create a clone of Reddit, the super popular social network. We’ll create subreddits, allow people to post into them, we’ll implement nested comments, and uploading images.

YouTube clone

Create your own YouTube! We’ll let people create channels, upload videos and serve them via a player, subscribe to channels, we’ll add search, pagination, and more!

Digital downloads website

Create something similar to Gumroad, but for one single user. Say you create ebooks (or anything else that’s digital), and you want to sell them. We’ll make a private area to upload and add all the details about the digital products, and the frontend-facing area will handle purchases through Stripe and we’ll let people download the files and leave reviews.

Rental apartment website

Imagine Airbnb, but for your own apartment. Instead of a marketplace of houses, it’s a site dedicated to just your house. You set the rates, there’s an availability calendar, people can book nights directly on your site. We’ll have total control and no fees.

Site with a private members area

Create a website on which you can create a private members-only area. Members will pay a monthly fee using Stripe to join the members area, and inside it we’ll add something that our users will want to pay for. Like Patreon, but on our own website.

Tripadvisor/Yelp clone

Depending on where you live, you might be used to opening Tripadvisor or Yelp for reviews of the place you’re in. We’re going to create something similar, with places and activities and reviews, except for a local place. Think of a tourist area near you and imagine a website that is highly focused on that and its hotels, restaurants, shops.

Project management SaaS

If you’ve ever used a tool like Basecamp or Asana, you know how it makes collaboration simple. People will pay to access and use our app. We’ll create a simple project management app with free trial, signup, monthly payment plans with Stripe for users, cancellation, etc.

E-commerce website

Create a real-world e-commerce shop that sells physical items. We’ll add items into an admin interface, people will browse and shop for items, add them to the cart, and will checkout. We’ll send the order to the shop owner and they’ll take care of shipping etc.

Here's an important note:

PHASE I of the BOOTCAMP will be a 10-weeks long cohort.

PHASE II of the BOOTCAMP will be open ended.

In the first part you'll be joining a group of students like you, learning all at the same time.

In the second part you’ll have more flexibility, you can decide which projects to work on, depending on your needs and interests. You'll still have access to a community of people working on your same project. But now we'll not have the "weekly pressure" any more. We're free to choose what to work on.

Sounds exciting, right?

Oh did I mention you’ll get FOREVER ACCESS to both the conceptual PHASE I, so you always go back to those lessons, and also to the PROTOTYPED projects?

That's it for now.

I'll send you more news as the open date approaches.

But if you want to find out more, read all about pricing, and read the testimonials of past alumni, head over to BOOTCAMP.DEV, the home page of the BOOTCAMP.
