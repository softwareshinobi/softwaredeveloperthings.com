The BOOTCAMP is NOW OPEN for SIGNUPS!

## Email Body

Hi!

I am super excited to announce that sign-ups for the 2023 Full-Stack Web Development BOOTCAMP are NOW OPEN!

I know how challenging it can be to break into the world of software development, especially as a beginner. But let me tell you, it doesn't have to be that way.

This bootcamp is a one-of-a-kind event that I only host once a year, with the sole purpose of helping beginners like you become web developers.

Will you be one of us?

Click here to join the BOOTCAMP!

Over the course of 10 weeks, we'll be diving deep into the basics of the web, including HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. You'll be part of a large cohort of students all focused on mastering web development, module by module, week by week.

After those 10 weeks, you will have access to 10 real-world projects, all built using React+Tailwind+Next.js, complete with course code and detailed explanations.

Enrollments to the 2023 cohort are open from TODAY, until January 31st.

On February 1st I will close sign-ups and the BOOTCAMP will officially start!

Head over to bootcamp.dev for all the details and to see a short video where I explain everything you need to know about the course.

PS: This is a course launch and I'll send out more emails this week. If you'd like to mute the launch, click here and you'll still be signed up for my regular newsletter with free tutorials and ebooks.
