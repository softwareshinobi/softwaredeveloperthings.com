## Let’s Get Started!

In the following sections, we cover the basics of Docker and followed by how to install Docker on Ubuntu.

## What Is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform.

Docker is used to automate the deployment of any application, using lightweight, portable containers.

Docker abstracts away the underlying operating system for applications and runs application as a process on the Docker Engine. 

## What Is The Docker Engine?

The Docker engine (or Docker daemon) represents the Docker Application server running on a given Docker Host.

These Docker hosts can be a Windows, Linux or MacOS servers.

## What Is The Big Deal About Docker?

Containerization with Docker allows development teams bundle and deploys apps in a standardized way.

This standardized bundling helps developers reuse docker images across projects without having to worry about application specific dependencies.

## What Is A Docker Image?

A Docker image is a pre-configured snapshot of an application.

These Docker Image snapshots are executable software that can be deployed to any computer that has the Docker Engine installed. 

Docker images are the building blocks for developing and deploying applications quickly.

Docker Images contain everything needed to run a unit of software including libraries, application code, and the base operating system.

## What Is A Docker Container?

A Docker container is a runtime instance of an Docker Image built with the Docker Engine.

Containers are deployed applications bundled with all necessary dependencies and configuration files.

Since the container isn’t tied to any one IT infrastructure, the container can be run on a different system or the in Cloud.

## Overview: How To Install Docker On Ubuntu

Installing Docker on your Ubuntu box is a fairly simple process.

Over the next few minutes, we will complete each of the following steps to install and configure Docker on your Ubuntu Server.

[ ] Update the Operating System Packages

[ ] Remove Any Old Docker Installations

[ ] Install the Docker Engine Packages

[ ] Verify the Docker Engine Is Installed Correctly

[ ] Configure User Permissions For The 
Docker Engine

[ ] Run Our First Docker Container On Your Ubuntu Server

## Getting Started Installing The Docker Engine

You don't need too much to get started.

[ ] Ubuntu Server with connection to the public Internet.

    * To download Docker Engine packages from the Ubuntu Software Repositories.

[ ] Root/sudo access on your Ubuntu Server.

    * To update the ubuntu server operating system packages and installations.
        
That’s it. So let’s get to it!

## So... How To Install The Docker Engine on Ubuntu?

Installing Docker on your Ubuntu machine is fairly straight forward.

In each section below we will perform the steps needed to install Docker on your Ubuntu Server.

## Update the Operating System Packages

We are going to install Docker using the Official Ubuntu Aptitude repositories.

To do that, we'll simply update your existing list of Aptitude packages.

```
sudo apt update
```

## Remove Any Old Docker Installations

Let's remove any possible Docker installations currently on your Ubuntu server.

```
sudo apt-get remove -y docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc docker-compose
```

## Install the Docker Engine Packages

The Docker Engine package installion is a quick one liner command.

We will install Docker Compose using the Aptitude Package manager.

```
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

## Verify the Docker Engine Is Installed Correctly


Now let’s verify The version Of Docker that we have installed:

```
sudo docker -v
```

After running this command you should see something similar to the following in the Terminal window.

```
Docker version 20.10.21, build 20.10.21-0ubuntu1~22.04.3
```
