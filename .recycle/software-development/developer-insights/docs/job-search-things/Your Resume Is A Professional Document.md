# Your Resume Is A Professional Document

## Introduction

Your resume is a professional document, not a school book report or an art project.  

Until every resume is done this way, yours will still stand out in the crowd. You are the product, and your resume is the marketing piece.

Like a brochure.

To find your perfect job you must differentiate yourself from the other people who will be interviewed.

And honestly it isn’t that hard to stand out and differentiate yourself from the others.


## Check The Filename Of Your Resume

You wouldn’t believe how many resumes i get with a filename like 

```
First Name Resume 2023 (3).docx
```

That’s just bad.

My favorite filename format is the following:

```
[FirstName]-[LastName]-[Job Title]-Resume.[FileExtension]
```

So that in turns, may look like this:

```
troy-burney-full-stack-developer-resume.pdf
```

Way better.

## Making Your Resume Specific

Your resume must be specific, individualized, easy to skim so it invites a closer reading.

Your resume must be focused on the differences you've made with your previous companies.

As well as the accomplishments you've achieved with - and for - them.

This tells the hiring company what you can do for them - and it IS about the hiring company, not you.

Show your value. Value is everything

## You Still Must Be Able To Do The Job

Of course... This all assumes you meet the requirements for the job.

Otherwise it doesn't matter how good your resume is!

So... skills and know how and confidence are important.

## Avoid These Big Mistakes

The resume is what gets you in the door.
