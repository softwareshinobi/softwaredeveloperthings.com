Email #1:  The Money Is In The List...Really?

Dear <firstname> ,

Congratulations for signing up as my valued
subscriber. In this 20 part mini-course, you 
will discover why list building is a matter
of life and death to most internet businesses
and you will unearth invaluable tips to list
building that will cost you tons in other places!

Many marketers love to use the term 'the money
is in the list'. What does it really mean and
what sort of list are you building anyway?

Lets use an example. You produce a guide on
losing weight fast. Then you spend tons of effort
and time to get a lot of traffic to go to your site.
So people start buying. But you realise that a lot
of customers make one purchase, disappear, and
never hear from them again. 

At the same time, you wonder why your profits
aren't higher...after all if you have 5,000 customers
the returns should be higher right? 

And that is where you need the subscriber's list.

You see, when you have a list of prospects who 
trust you and are willing to take a chance with your 
products, it becomes a potential gold mine because
these people will purchase whatever you have to offer
- and its all based on their perception of you as a 
trustworthy and honest marketer.

So right now kick back, relax, and slowly digest
these solid, proven tips seasoned marketers use to 
earn huge profits through their lists.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
