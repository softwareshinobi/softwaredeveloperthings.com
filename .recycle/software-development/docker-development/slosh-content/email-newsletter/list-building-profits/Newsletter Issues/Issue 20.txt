Email #20: Conclusion

Dear <firstname>,

As stated in the earlier emails, one of the recurring
themes you have to take note of is consent and 
providing value.

The most important thing in building any business,
on or offline is to have your customers buy from you
because they trust you and this trust manifests into
long term customer loyalty and tons of referrals on
their part. 

You always need to keep in mind that it takes a lot 
longer to build a reputation than it does to destroy one. 

You will also want to gauge your subscriber base to 
determine whether they respond better to lengthier 
emails or short ones.  This is a touchy subject and 
each list will react differently depending on the way
 that you structure your emails.

Personally, I use the KISS method : Keep it Short &
Sweet. Most of the time, my subscribers are happy
that i'm direct, to the point yet offer them value rather
then beat around the bush and try to squirm my way
through things.

And one more thing: Always be warm,  friendly and
open to your subscribers. People aren't stupid, they
can see whether you genuinely treat them with respect
and warmth or you look at them as walking cash cows.

So run with the tips and advice in this newsletter,
and if you forget the previous 19 emails, it is important 
to remember the tips I gave you in this last one.

All the best in your successful list building!

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
