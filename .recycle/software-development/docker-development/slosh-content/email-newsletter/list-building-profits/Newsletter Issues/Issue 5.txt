Email #5: Narrowing Down The Right Niche

Dear <firstname> ,

Lets say you choose a topic that has been popular 
since the beginning of the industrial age.

While it might be a topic that will stand the test of
 time, are people actually purchasing information 
within that market, or is there an abundance of free
 information so people won't be compelled to even 
glance at your site?

One easy way to tell is by visiting the marketplaces 
that feature products in various categories and niches. 
ClickBank, or eBay.com can give you an idea as to 
whether people are purchasing information in your 
market.  

To narrow down your topics and choose the very 
best one, the easiest way to begin is by conducting
a bit of quick market research.   

Using google: Visit Google.com and enter in the main
 keyword phrase for your topic (Example: acne problems) 
to determine your competition and how popular your topic is.  

Is there a lot of competition in this market? Competition isn't
 necessarily a bad thing in this case, you are trying to determine 
how profitable the industry is, and the more advertisers, the 
more profitable (and popular) the market is. 

Using Clickbank: Explore the clickbank marketplace. You
can determine how many products are available for your topic,
and since you are likely going to want to promote affiliate 
products to your list (even if you have your own product line), 
you will want to verify that there are a significant number of 
products available.

You can also go to online communities and see what their 
pressing needs are to fulfill them. Remember, you can generate
ideas for content from the existing questions and discussions.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
