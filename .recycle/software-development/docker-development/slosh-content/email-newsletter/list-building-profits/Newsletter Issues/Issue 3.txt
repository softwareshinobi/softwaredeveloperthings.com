Email #3:  The Equipment You'll Need (Part II)

Dear <firstname> ,

The most important tool of list building is the website, 
making it easier for your contacts have a place to come 
to and find you. 

They also need a place where they can securely leave 
their email and name. You must ensure that they do not 
have any difficulty in the process. 

You should always endeavor to give them something of 
value to remember. Your website is practically your main 
point of contact with your users. 

So make sure you build a site that is good to look at. That 
does not mean graphics rich and jazzy, but something that 
is designed to be professional and effective. 

It must attract your users enough for them to want to browse
 around and check out what you have for them. Use pleasant 
colors and relevant images, a good layout and useful, solid 
information and content.

Write your content in such a way that it draws their attention
 – like a magnetic headline, bulleted points, etc. On top of 
everything else, it should endorse your own image. You see,
your visitors are only going to be there for seconds before they
 move on to browse elsewhere. It must have something special 
for your prospect to remember and come back.  

At this point of time, before they leave, it is imperative you 
capture their contacts by asking them to sign up in exchange 
for something valuable to them – like a free download or 
newsletter. In this manner, your list continues to build. 

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
