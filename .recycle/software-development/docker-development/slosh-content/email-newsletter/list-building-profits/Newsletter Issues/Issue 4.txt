Email #4:  What Niche?

Dear <firstname> ,

Okay so its time to select a niche market that 
you can build your huge, profitable list with.

You will want to evaluate your niche markets, 
see what other email marketers are offering, 
what your prospects are interested in and how 
you can offer useful information that is catered 
towards their requests.

You want to focus on markets with longevity 
so that you are setting up your lists for long term
profitability.

Analyze the market that you are considering focusing
on.  Does it consist of people who are likely going to
solve their problems quickly, leaving little reason to 
stay subscribed to your list?  Is your market based on 
a passing fad, rather than stable trend?

For example, a long term list building campaign would
 be a market such as the weight loss industry, where 
people are always going to struggle with their weight,
and even those who temporarily lose weight may still 
feel they benefit from your information and guidance.

You want to focus your effort on creating a list that you 
will be able to cater to for years to come, meaning that 
these subscribers will purchase from you again and again. 

The entire point of building a list in the first place is so 
you have an active, ready-made customer base that you 
can target with affiliate promotions and eventually your 
own product launches.  This means that you need to build 
a list that will stand the test of time.

Next up, we'll show you how to evaluate the actual profitability
of your niche.

To your huge, profitable lists,
