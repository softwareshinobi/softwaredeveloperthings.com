Email #16: List Building Tactics – The Squeeze Page (Part I)

Dear <firstname>,

A squeeze page is a very basic web page that 
features your opt-in box and autoresponder code.
This is where potential subscribers enter in their 
name and email address to be added to your list.  

You want to focus on keeping your squeezes pages 
simple, and avoid posting any external links or 
complicated navigation bars, in fact, squeeze pages
should consist of a single page that prompts your 
visitor into subscribing to your list, eliminating any
distractions or chance of your visitor being distracted 
by anything else.

There are important aspects to this page that you will 
want to keep in mind, including:

Punchy Headline - Just like a headline to a sales page, 
you need your squeeze page to capture your visitor’s 
attention and prompt them into action. Your headline
 should be written so that you are able to keep them 
on the page long enough to subscribe, while your 
secondary headline should feature one of your major
points of interest.

Body - With squeeze or landing pages, you should
typically keep the body text to a minimum, describing
only the highlights and benefits of subscribing to your 
list as well as a brief overview of what your subscriber 
can expect to receive once a confirmed member. 

The body text of your squeeze page should be brief but
descriptive. What this means is that you need to cut down
the amount of text featured on this page, yet still highlight
what it is that you are offering and what your subscribers
will receive.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
