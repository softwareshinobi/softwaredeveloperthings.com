## question

i'm pretty reckless with flights, but i don't do layover situations less than an hour.

## answer

everything in the universe would have to go great for you in order to make a flight with that tight of a window. 

that 45 minutes isn't 45 minutes of you at the gate eating a bag of chips.

it's 45 minutes from when the airline says you are supposed to land to when the airport says you are supposed to take off on the other flight.

typically that time is AFTER the last call.

t time is AFTER the last call.time is AFTER the last call.ou are supposed to have landed.

that time doesn't include deboarding, the run to the next spot, the train, the couple blocking everybody on the moving stairwell.

1.5 hours, yea. i'd rock with that. 45 mins, not gone be able to do it.

also, don't be me.
