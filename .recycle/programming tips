I'm new to the group. However,  I have observed that so many are groping in the dark when it comes to planning or designing an app or project.
Here's something that I hope can help those struggling to have a good start in app design and planning.
SUGGESTED APPROACH TO ANALYSIS & DESIGN (in a nutshell)
1. Know the requirements (outputs of the app)
2. From the requirements, determine what data sources (inputs) are needed to produce the requirements (outputs)
3. Connect data sources (inputs) to requirements (outputs) by defining what processes (data transformations, also called functions) that are needed to produce the requirements (outputs).
4. To make things simple, let each function do only one thing. If a transform is complex, break it up into smaller functions that do only one thing. This will make debugging and modifying easier.
5. Develop your sense for the aesthetic, via your imagination, and observing the work of others. Towards this end, don't just think of the earnings you will make, develop a LOVE FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING - this is what will fire up your imagination, creativity and innovation
