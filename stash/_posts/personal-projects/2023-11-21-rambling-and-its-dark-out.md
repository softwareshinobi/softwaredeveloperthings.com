let's talk today about how to make personal projects as a developer.

there is a progression and you've gotten to the next gate.

you self taught yourself a language, a stack, a whatever.

you ready to make your own creation.

## choosing a personal project

first... welcome to the land of the gods.

so i can't choose for you, but i can give you ideas to come up with ideas.

so. let's begin.

## without ado

let's rattle a bunch of project ideas based on who you might be.

## personal project ideas

alright. so identify something in your life that has maintenence. 

you can make a personal project, a software situation, to track and log maintenance 'events'. 

## here is a scenario

i have a pet/kids/car/dependent/house/something that needs maintenenance

## what you are really building

you are building an incident management system in corporate speak.

an incident management system tracks events and information about events.

an incident management "at work" might look like this:

* every time a customer returned a project

* every time somebody tried to log into an account with a bad password

* every time a machine malfunctioned

* every flight taking off or landing in MIA

these are all 'incidents' that an incident management system tracks.

an incident isn't bad. it's basically an event.

so let's in this article we are talking event based transaction systems.

## what this dumb ass app could do

your personal project tracks every time your dog shits.

your personal project tracks every time you got an oil change. 

your personal project tracks your car gas mileage over time.

your personal project tracks your Amazon purchases.

these kind of apps are transactional.

something happened, and there was a result, or a dollar amount, or a change.

something happened and you created a record of it.

your personal project is the record system.

could be. it's just an idea.

## how to get started

so you've come up with the bullshit project idea.

now we move towards creating your dumb ass app.

1. create a repo in github and call it whatever the hell you want, you can change it

1. in the readme file put what the app could do. just make a list.

1. in the readme file put what the app does at a high level. 

## for example.

```

# readme.md

this dumb ass app tracks every time i water my plant

i can log every time i water my plant 

i can end the date i watered my plant

i can enter comments about how my plant looks

i can upload a picture of my plant

i can view a list of every time i watered my plant

```

you don't gotta write a book. you don't have to build a space ship.

## now what?

go do something. create a reality. 

create the dumb ass app you picked.

and don't get married.

just play around.

and push it to github.

it's more important that you tried something. it's less important that you made it perfect or pretty.

SHIP EARLIER.
