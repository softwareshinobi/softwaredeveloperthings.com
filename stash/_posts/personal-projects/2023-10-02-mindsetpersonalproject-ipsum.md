let's talk today about how to make personal projects as a developer.

there is a progression and you've gotten to the next gate.

you self taught yourself a language, a stack, a whatever.

the person the video did some bullshit and you ready to make your own.

## it starts in your head

these thoughts are my own but my thoughts.

don't fall in love with or get married to a persnoal project.

meaning... don't think that you have to see a project through to the end. i'll explain why in another article, but the reason is because there never is a such thing as 'done'.

so if you keep trying to wait until done, you'll never realease.

## mindset #2

release something AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

doesn't matter what the project is.

doesn't matter how basic.

get a github project up NOW.

put in the readme what the project will do.
