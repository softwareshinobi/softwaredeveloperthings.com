"Brad" doesn't give a fuck and so you shouldn't either.

## in this article

i'll have a beer and share my thoughts and my experiences as a developer in 'corporate'.

## there is no disclaimer

i was going to put one.

but you are your own person, do you what you want.

i've been a software development consultant over a decade.

## don't do that leetcode / data structures bullshit

first nobody cares.

you are 'grinding leetcode'. congrats.

you've wasted your time.

## the big boss doesn't give a fuck

We are going to make a name.

"Brad".

Brad is the guy your project team works for basically.

he's the guy with the checkbook and the power.

your boss and your boss's boss have to answer to this guy.

you answer to them.

you are a developer.

you are building the shit that Brad wants.

## about "Brad"

Brad could be the product manager at some company in Europe

Brad could be Sharon who is the program manager at HQ

Brad could be the government liason

Brad could be the church that's paying you to make them a website.

## they don't care

they don't know what leet code is.

and they don't care.

--

they don't know the difference between a bubble sort and a merge sort.

nor do they know about runtime optimization or any of that shit.

Brad needs something built, and you need to be able to do it.


## what am i saying?

focus on creation.

don't focus on getting a job and chasing the 'getting a job trends'.

the client. your manager.

they don't give a shit. nor do they care.

your time and energy are better spent.

go make some personal projects instead.

## but... but... this job wants me to know leetcode

so?

## but... but... i failed an interview because i didn't grind leetcode

so?

## outro

go build something.

don't chase trends.

holla.

## Namaste.
