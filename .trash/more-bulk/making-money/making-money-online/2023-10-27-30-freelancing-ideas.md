## Introduction

Below you will find a list that is comprised of 30 freelance
business ideas you can start. 

As with any kind of business, you should do extensive research into the industry and create a business plan. 

## Freelancing Has Big Benefits

One of the biggest benefits of freelance is that you get almost unlimited freedom. So, with all of these, you can transform and change them to fit with your skills and interests. One of the best parts about starting a freelance business is the choices you get to make. As well as choosing exactly what you get to do (from your industry to your services specifically);

## Get The Clients And The Projects

you will get to choose your clients and your projects. Make sure that you are making choices that you enjoy—not what you think you should do. There is no point in starting a business that you will not enjoy working for. Being successful in many of these things will require you to be highly skilled. These skills will naturally develop further as your business does, but it will give you an advantage if you already have a talent for it.

## Consider Some Of These

So, with all of this in mind, read through this list of freelance business ideas that you can start. Take inspiration, thinkabout your preexisting skills and interests. Change, define, and alter these to fit your dream life.

## 1. Writing

Freelance writing is an incredibly broad business, so you should narrow it down to a niche. But, in essence, anything people want to read about, you can write about. If you have a good grasp of language and grammar and you love to get your thoughts out there, then think about becoming a writer.

## 2. Journalism

Freelance journalists are not tied to a specific organization. It can be a good option for people who do not align with mainstream journalism and would like more freedom with the kinds of articles they produce.

## 3. Ghost-writing

Ghostwriting is writing that you, personally, do not get credit for. It usually ends up published anonymously or, it is published on behalf of an organization or person; just not you. It is a good option if you love to write, but do not necessarily care about the glory. Writing content for other people is a very popular freelance business, and clients love to use good quality ghostwriters.

## 4. Editing

If you are a nerd for grammar and a lover of structure, becoming a freelance editor could be for you. If you have ever read something and thought "this is so close to being perfect, but I could do a better job," consider becoming a freelance editor.

## 5. Proofreading

Similar to editing, but would require fewer edits, naturally.
Help people by giving them a quick once over before they
finalize their work. Proofreading would likely be more about
quick grammar checks than major structural changes. Be
careful not to blur the line too much between editing and
proofreading; set expectations with your clients clearly. You
can, of course, do both, but make sure that your services
are priced to reflect this.

## 6. Bookkeeping

If you have a knack for math and understand business,
helping other businesses with their books is a great
freelance business. Bookkeeping is something that many
people struggle with and would rather outsource, positioning
yourself correctly could cause clients to flock to you. You
could do ongoing bookkeeping work with companies on a
regular basis, or on-demand work—just make sure your
services will be priced to reflect this.

## 7. Data entry

Data entry is a good job for people who love to organize and
keep things neat. Especially, for those who also love helping
others. Data entry is not for everyone, but those who love it,
really excel at it. If you are quick and thorough, then you
could find yourself with a strong business.

Data entry may expand into data analysis or data
verification. You should make sure that you outline exactly
what your service will be so that clients do not get confused
looking for one element but getting another.

## 8. Graphic design

From logos to color schemes to graphics, there is an
abundance of design elements that can be done freelance.
While you may need to invest money into quality software
and invest time into developing a distinctive style. Most
online businesses will need graphic design at some point,
so developing your skill towards a niche will likely make you
popular and will give you a positive reputation and receptive
audience.

## 9. Photo editing

These days, photos are everything. We have all seen the
popularization of filters and editing; except, sometimes, it
also needs filters that make the picture look good, but still
natural and “unedited.” Being skilled in touching up and
altering photos could mean that a career in photo editing
could be for you.

## 10. Photography

If you have an eye for photography, then a freelance
photography career is a flash option for you. This is a great
example of business based on the monetization of your
hobbies. Many people will need professional photographs
taken, but may not know where to look. Marketing yourself
as a niche, local, and skilled photographer could be a good
freelance option for you.

## 11. Illustration

If you have a talent for drawing, become a freelance
illustrator. Illustration is not something that many people can
do to a high level, so capitalize on that and get illustrating.
Be careful with making sure the brief is clearly outlined to
begin with, and make sure that you include a set number of
revisions so that clients do not continue to demand more
work.

## 12. Web design

To be a web designer, you do not necessarily need to have
studied for years; some web designers just have a greater
than average understanding of common website platforms
(such as WordPress) and a talent for making them look
nice. You could build a business in updating, or renovating
websites.

## 13. Website creation

Full on website creation requires more detail than website
design and may involve building websites from scratch. It
could, in some circumstances, be deeper than knowing how
to skillfully navigate website building platforms. Again,
though, as with all elements of a freelance career--the
choice is yours.

## 14. Software programming

Programming is not something that many people excel at, it
is a skill that takes time and dedication to understand. This
means it is a great opportunity for you to make bank doing
something you love and have developed a skill at. There are
numerous programming languages, that are for different
things and have different benefits. Figure out which you are
best at and how you can transfer that skill into a tangible
product and marketable service.

## 15. Translating

Do you speak more than one language? Well, translating
could be a lucrative option for you. There is almost always a
high demand for people who can translate something from
one language to another. Globalization and the
internationalization of content has meant that rarely is
something professionally published in only one language—
and the ability to write in a native capacity in a second, or
third, language is an excellent foundation for a business.

## 16. Transcribing

Transcribing occurs when you listen to audio and then write
down exactly what you hear. It can be from interviews or
subtitling videos. If you are a quick typist and listen clearly
and accurately it could be a great option for you.

## 17. Teaching

Teaching is something that is easy to do online. For
example, you could run courses or provide seminars in
something that you are good at. You could educate and
train others in skills that you have already fully develop.

## 18. Tutoring

While similar to teaching, tutoring gives off a more personal
feeling. You can share your expertise; whether for kids or
older students, or even just adults looking to learn
something new. There is a huge market for online English
teachers, or for other language tutoring.

## 19. Video production

Videos are a huge part of online content and being able to
produce them fills a gap that many people cannot. Whether
it be storyboarding, filming, or creating the content itself,
being able to produce one of the most popular forms of
online entertainment is an exciting business prospect.
Particularly, if you develop a video production niche and are
able to become a prime figure in that industry.

## 20. Video editing

If video production is not for you, editing videos may be a
good stepping-stone. Editing is something that many people
struggle with—whether it be navigating fancy software or
determining which content is appropriate for the final cut.
You could edit your own videos or edit videos for others.
You could brand yourself as being skilled in editing a
particular style or in a certain genre.

## 21. Voiceovers

Becoming a voice over artist is a wonderful freelance career
choice if you love the sound of your own voice—no pun
intended! Clients often have an idea for the voice they want;
so make sure you market the characteristics of your voice
clearly.

## 22. Virtual assistant

Being a virtual assistant is exactly what it sounds like.
Virtual assistants often complete small tasks for businesses
on a regular basis who looking to outsource some functions.
Depending on workload, virtual assistants can work for
many people at once.

## 23. Administrative Assistant

Again, if you have a skill and high experience in something
like admin you can turn it into a business. Admin is an area
in which many people are lacking skills and you can market
yourself to take the stress out of their business.

## 24. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO helps to increase traffic to websites by using specific
terms. It is often essential to the success of businesses, so
if you are skilled in this, and can show proven results
becoming a specialist in Search Engine Optimization will
provide a unique and challenging business.

## 25. Marketing

Online marketing is an exponentially growing business.
From working with websites, businesses, email lists, and ad
campaigns: it is a very rewarding field. People will always
have a need for marketing and giving someone else’s
marketing a fresh boost is a wonderful freelance business
idea.

## 26. Social media marketing

Social media marketing is all about helping brands make the
most of their social media platforms—an excellent
occupation for those of us who spent hours scrolling through
feeds on their phones and have gained a lot of know-how
from it!

## 27. Brand management

Brand management is a great freelance business idea if you
already have skills in that area. Brand management is a skill
that many other freelancers or small business owners may
not know a whole lot about; so, you could make yourbusiness helping their business. Brand management
workers will need to be results driven and understand many
elements of the business process.

## 28. Content moderation

Into content creation, but not skilled in the creating part
(yet)? Moderation could be for you. Sometimes requiring
checking in on the competition or simply monitoring replies
and comments. Content moderators check to make sure
everything is running as planned—with reputations and
perceptions remaining positive.

## 29. eCommerce

Working in eCommerce can mean anything from writing
helping to set up online stores, product descriptions,
facilitating collaborations, engaging ad campaigns, or
helping with online store launches. eCommerce workers
often choose to specialize in certain platforms or product
types. This kind of work is often something that clients will
choose to outsource as it is not something that many people
understand fully.

## 30. Content creation

Whether for yourself or for something else, having a knack
for understanding trends and creating captivating content to
generate engagement is a business unique to the twenty-
first century.So, there you have it! Thirty freelance business ideas that
you can start from your home. Before leaping in you should,
of course, do extensive research. Freelance businesses are

desires.
