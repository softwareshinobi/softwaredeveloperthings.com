# 8 Easy To Implement Resume Editing Tips

## Introduction

It's amazing what a well-written and nicely presented resume can do for your job search.

Before you send your Resume out, follow this checklist to guarantee you are sending out an excellent quality representation of yourself.

## Resume Editing Tip #1 // Grammar, Spelling, Punctuation

Use the grammar and spell check function of your text editor, then print it out and read the document word for word.

Spell checker doesn't know that you meant "manager" when you actually typed "manger."

It's a good idea to use a Text To Speech (TTS) app on the Internet. These Text to speech websites read your resume out loud.

Hearing your resume out loud will help you catch misspelled words and poorly worded sentences.

These apps are free and there are many of them.

I personally use this one (it’s free, btw): https://ttsreader.com/

## Resume Editing Tip #2 // Capitalization

Keep it simple. When in doubt... 

    • all letters in a sentence should be lowercase except the first letter. (except for common names)
        ◦ Ex: Managed the team Git repository and access control

    • all section titles should be in Book Caps. (the first letter of every word is capitalized)
        ◦ Ex: Professional Experiences

## Resume Editing Tip #3 // Punctuation

Check for proper use of commas and semicolons.

## Resume Editing Tip #4 // Run-on Sentences

Check to make sure you do not have run-ons that are hard to read.

When in doubt... always make a sentence shorter.

Shorter sentences are always better than longer sentences. Always.

## Resume Editing Tip #5 // Consistency Of Content

You must be consistent with your number usage (dates / money / numbers), plurals, and abbreviations.

For example, don't list one date as 8/2021 and then list another date as 03/15/2020.

That's inconsistent date formatting.

Also, be aware of listing software consistently (for example: the use of abbreviations).

As an example, "MS Word" and "Microsoft Word" are correct ways to refer to the same thing. But different ways of doing so.

So... don't mix them up across your Resume.
Pick one style and use it all across your Resume.

## Resume Editing Tip #6 // The Education Section

Put the Education section near the Bottom of your Resume.

When you have a degree, list only the year that you obtained your degree.

For example:

When you list your dates..., (i.e.: 9/2018 to 1/2021)

Many resume-scanning systems will not always recognize that you obtained a degree. Only that you attended college for a period of time.

So take this into consideration and remove the month from your Education dates.

Plus nobody cares.

## Resume Editing Tip #7 // The Use Of Ampersands

Ampersands (&) do not belong on a resume. 

There are a few exceptions. One exception being a well-known company name (AT&T). 

Another exception is well-known industry terms like profit and loss (P&L).

Other than that... write out the "and" instead using an ampersand.

## Resume Editing Tip #8 // Hyperlinks

All e-mail and web addresses that you list need to be deactivated in your resume.

Meaning that the links do not actually work and take you to an Internet web page.

This also means the links do not have formatting different than standard text.

As a simple rule of thumb, remove functioning links and URLs.

They are ugly and serve no purpose.
