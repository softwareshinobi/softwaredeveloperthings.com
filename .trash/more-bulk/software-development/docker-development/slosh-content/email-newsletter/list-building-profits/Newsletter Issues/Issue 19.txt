Email #19: POP! Goes The Opt-In

Dear <firstname>,

Pop-ups can either be an effective list building tool 
or an utter annoyance, depending on the way you 
use it. Traditional pop ups have a problem –they 
can be easily blocked, what with the number of 
pop up blocking tools on the Internet. 

It is possible to get past the blocker, though. There
are what is called unblockable DHTML pop ups.
These are used by many online businesses when 
they partner with other sites to share traffic. 

You can create these DHTML pop-ups using free 
software downloadable off the web. They are simple
 to make without having to use the services of a 
professional. 

The most important thing is what you write in the 
Pop-up. Your words must be convincing enough for 
the visitor to take action, namely fill in his or her
contact information in the form. 

A few tips and tricks you could use are:

-Offering something in exchange for their email ids. 
This could be a free report or an ebook. 

-The title of your pop-up could be an effective keyword 
that can also help in taking it up in the search engine
 ranking. Make it catchy. 

-Write a really attractive headline. Your visitors are not 
going to wait forever while they browse through the Internet. 
You must get their attention in the first few seconds – so
write something that will capture their eye and make them 
continue to read. 

There are many other ways you can utilise the pop up but
i've given you the most effective methods. 

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
