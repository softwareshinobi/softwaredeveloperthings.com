Email #18: Forums? Why Forums?

Dear <firstname>,

Forums are the most interactive places on the 
Internet where we see huge amounts of traffic. 
People constantly post messages regarding their 
opinions on various issues. 

They also ask questions that are addressed by
other forum members. We can find forums that 
discuss issues related to our line of business and
 take part in the ongoing conversation.

Many forums let you add a signature file to your post. 
But this must be done properly; otherwise you will 
be labeled a spammer.

Forums are a very viable list building strategy, and 
the right thing to do here is to launch yourself as an
expert in your field.

You can easily find numerous forums for your specific
 keyword relating to your business. Become a member 
of several of these. 

When you sign up, create what is called a signature –
 which will be appended to the end of every message 
you post on the forum. Just put your name and website
URL or squeeze page URL.

Important: DO NOT hard sell.

Browse around the forum posts to see whether you can
make a meaningful contribution to a thread of conversations
or answer any questions that are yet to be responded to.

Regular participation will build your credibility and show
 you as someone who is genuinely interested in the topic. 
Trust will build through your communication and then 
eventually, they will visit your website, and likely refer
others as well.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
