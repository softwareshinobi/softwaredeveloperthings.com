Email #10: Making Your List Come Alive

Dear <firstname> ,

Your favorite newsletters probably have a little
personality, and you like the author’s writing 
style.  In other words, it  feels like a personal 
letter from a friend. It's alive, its sexy!

“Romance” your readers, and build a relationship
with them.  In other words, don’t treat your readers
 like “numbers” or like dollar signs.  Remember
 that there are real humans behind those email 
addresses. Write as if you are talking to one of them.  

Another method was mentioned earlier: offering 
deep discounts or “cheap” products. Just as you can 
convert subscribers into buyers, you can also convert
'budget' buyers into 'big spending' buyers.

Someone who is unfamiliar with you might not be 
willing to spend $50 or $100. However, they may feel 
perfectly comfortable “risking” five or ten bucks.

That’s how the relationship develops.  You offer a high 
quality report for at an “impulse purchase” price 
(usually under $20), and a new reader feels comfortable
 taking that chance on me. When you provide value for 
the money backed by good customer service, this 
customer will now have a good experience and trust you.

Soon enough, people will respond positively and not think
two seconds about purchasing a product over $100 from 
you. 

So remember, when you treat people in your list with
warmth, trust and offer them valuable solutions, its a 
given that they will come back to you more than once.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
