Email #15: List Building Tactics – Article Marketing

Dear <firstname> ,

Whether you become involved in article marketing
to drive targeted (free) traffic to your websites, or 
you plan to utilize the popularity of article directories
 to grow a list, it’s an incredibly effective strategy.

The fastest way to build a list using articles is 
by outsourcing a package of 20 articles, each one
 focused on your niche market.  Once you have
these articles written, you edit them quickly adding
in your name and squeeze page URL into the footer.

If you are submitting your articles to places like 
EzineArticles.com, you can include your squeeze 
page’s URL within the resource box.

Writing articles that are keyword rich will allow 
you to quickly rank within the major search engines,
 as well as generate traffic from direct searches on 
the article directory itself.  

Create your article marketing schedule and consistently
work towards spreading your message and getting as 
many articles out there as possible.

The higher the number of articles that you have in 
circulation, the more traffic you will receive, so put 
aside maybe an hour a day to submit articles for a 
couple of weeks to get the traffic rolling in, and then
continue to post new articles every other week, or as 
time allows.

In the next issue, we will be talking about the main
weapon of all serious list building marketers – The
squeeze page.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
