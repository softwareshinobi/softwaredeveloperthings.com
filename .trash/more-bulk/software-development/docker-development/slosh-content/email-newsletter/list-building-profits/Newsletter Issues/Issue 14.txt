Email #14: List Building Tactics - Ezines

Dear <firstname> ,

Lets go on to Ezines today. Ezines are not only 
useful as great list builders, but are an inexpensive
and efficient way to keep in touch with your 
subscribers and interact with them.

It's also a good publicity tool for your website. 
Ezines help in following up with the customer 
on an ongoing basis. Through its content, the 
subscriber is encouraged to visit your website often.

Ensure that you have an online version of your ezine 
on your website. This will help it to be indexed by the
 search engines and bring lots of visitors to your site.  

Tip: In each issue of your ezine, use keywords related 
to your business because gradually your ezine pages 
will get into the search engines.

When you plan your ezine, decide on a specific theme
that suits your market, and the kind of people you want
signing up with you to buy your products. This will 
enhance the type of list you want to build. 

You want the people who opt to receive your newsletter 
to read them and recommend them to others, who will
also build your list by subscribing to your ezine. 

Tip: Your subscribe link must appear on every page of 
your website, preferably at the top left hand corner as 
everyone tends to look there first. Remember to mention 
what you are offering for free near all the links.

Always remember this: Let the tone of your ezine be 
informative, instead of as a tool to increase sales. This 
will give it a sort of consultative approach and build 
good relationships with your list. 

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
