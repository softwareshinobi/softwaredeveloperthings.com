Email #17: List Building Tactics – The Squeeze Page (Part II)

Dear <firstname>,

In the previous email, we talked about how squeeze
pages help funnel your prospects into your list and
the important points to note when creating an effective
squeeze page. 

Today we're continuing where we left off: The main
body of the squeeze page.

Using bullets to emphasize key features and benefits 
is a common method of drafting an effective and 
compelling squeeze page, and it helps break down the 
information into small bits that are easier for the reader
to digest and understand, so consider using them when
designing your landing page.

Your site must provide crisp content. Write it in such a 
way that it draws their attention – like a magnetic headline,
bulleted points, etc.

Tip: Squeeze pages designed to showcase the opt-in form
without an overload of other distracting elements, always 
work best.

You need to place emphasis on your call to action, which 
provides your visitors with instructions on what they must
do in order to be added to your list. You should consider 
using arrow graphics or a sub headline directly above the 
opt-in form, directing your visitor to enter in their information
and join the list.

You will also want to offer a guarantee that you will not share,
rent or distribute your subscriber’s information, reassuring 
your list member that their information is safe with you.  

When it comes to listing the benefits you need to be clear
and concise.  Make sure they understand ‘what is in it for 
them’, and what you are offering that will assist them.

To your huge, profitable lists,

“Your Name”
“Your Website Link”
