Unable to mount 2TB NTFS hard drive in Ubuntu 14.04

Can somebody assist me on this one?

Error mounting /dev/sdg4 at /media/jote/DATA_4: Command-line `mount -t "ntfs" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177" "/dev/sdg4" "/media/jote/DATA_4"' exited with non-zero exit status 13: Error reading bootsector: Input/output error
Failed to mount '/dev/sdg4': Input/output error
NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a
SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows
then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
it and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.
/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation
for more details.

I asked a question on AskUbuntu and got the answer to use Windows's chkdsk /f to repair the 'corrupted' NTFS partitions. However, my partition is perfectly healthy! Can someone explain me why a tool like PartedMagic - which is also Linux - can perfectly mount and use this drive and Ubuntu 14.04 cannot?

    And have you run chkdsk /f -> reboot -> chkdsk /f as it says? (The reboot isn't strictly necessary, but it re-settles Windows) –

    Please use <pre> before and </pre> after your error message text - it makes it readable in comparision to what is above. –

    Check NTFS driver versions, on Windows and when you can and cannot use the drive - Do they match? Which versions do you see/use? –

    @BigChris: I ran chkdsk /f and rebooted into Windows twice, as said in the error message. –

Install ntfs-3g with sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g. Then run the ntfsfix command on your NTFS partition.

    ntfsfix v2.0.0 (libntfs 10:0:0)

    Usage: ntfsfix [options] device

    Attempt to fix an NTFS partition.

    -h, --help             Display this help
    -V, --version          Display version information

    For example: ntfsfix /dev/hda6

    Developers' email address: linux-ntfs-dev@lists.sf.net Linux NTFS homepage: http://www.linux-ntfs.org

=======================================

You can use a program called ntfsprogs. If its not installed, you can install it by, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:

sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs

Once installed, you need to find out you NTFS drive name, just do sudo fdisk -l, to find that out, once you know the name, then

sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXX

Make sure that you replace the XX with your drive's name.

Note: Whenever you're dealing with partition, make sure that you have a complete backup just to be on the safe side.

===================================

sudo apt-get install testdisk

Then run it:

sudo testdisk

and follow the instructions. You must search for partitions and then write the changes.

The issue has been resolved from a Windows PC using the "chkdsk" command. https://neosmart.net/wiki/chkdsk/

Windows will automatically repair the corrupted file system.

It works :D
